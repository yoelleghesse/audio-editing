This script uses the PyDub library to manipulate audio files in various ways. It loads an audio file, performs operations like reversing, exporting segments, and merging multiple audio segments, and exports the processed audio files.

Install PyDub:

``pip install pydub``

Run the script:

``python audio_processing.py``

Ensure that the input audio file (beat.wav in this example) is located in the same directory as the script or provide the correct path to the file and adjust the file names and paths as necessary to match your file structure.
